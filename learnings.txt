Exception Handling:

We handle exceptions with two blocks, try and except.

The try block is just that, the word try followed by a colon. Inside of the block,
indented, is the code that you think might 'cause an issue.

This block will only trigger if the code in the try caused a ValueError. If the code in the try triggered a
TypeError instead, though, this code would never run.
You'll want to create an except block for every type of exception your try block might cause.

Finally, you'll probably want an else block. This block will happen if your try didn't cause any exceptions.
